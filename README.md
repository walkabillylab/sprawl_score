## Chapter 1: Background
Urban sprawl is of interested to multiple disciplines including, urban planning, public health, economics, and transportation engineering (Knaap, Song, Ewing, & Clifton, 2005). A consensus on the definition of urban sprawl is lacking. Urban sprawl is loosely defined as inefficient, unordered, and unorganized urban growth, which manifests in the forms of decentralization, fragmentation, and low-density of residence (Ewing, Pendall, & Chen, 2002). 
The negative impacts of urban sprawl have been widely studied. There is ample evidence that urban sprawl significantly correlates with increased energy use, pollution, traffic congestion (Ewing & Hamidi, 2015). It also contributes to a decline in community cohesiveness and the deconstruction of wildlife habitats. The impact of urban sprawl on public health has also been studied. Past research has suggested that urban sprawl is significantly associated with physical inactivity (Frumkin, 2002), higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (Ross et al., 2007) and odds of being obese (Ewing, Brownson, & Berrigan, 2006), lower traffic safety (Ewing & Dumbaugh, 2009), and higher prevalence of heart disease (Griffin et al., 2013). 
Numerous multi-dimensional approaches have been developed to construct urban sprawl indices. For example, Galster et al. (2001) conceptually defined urban sprawl with eight distinct dimensions: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity, mixed uses, and proximity. Ewing et al. (2003) developed an urban sprawl index at the metropolitan area level with four dimensions of urban forms, namely residential density, street accessibility, land use mix, and degree of centering. This index was developed at the county level as well but with the first two dimensions only. Their research team recently updated the county-level index with all four dimensions, in parallel with the metropolitan area level index (Ewing et al., 2014). Frenkel and Ashkenazi (2008) measured urban sprawl by weighting thirteen variables from three dimensions ??? density, scatterness, and mixture of land uses; Arribas-Bel et al. (2011) proposed a conceptual framework for measuring urban sprawl which is composed of two categories: one, urban morphology with dimensions scattering, connectivity, and availability of open space; and two, internal composition with dimensions density, decentralization, and land-use mix.
Previous studies predominantly study urban sprawl at large-area levels, for example, the Census Metropolitan Area. Analyzing urban sprawl at a finer geographical scale (i.e., smaller area level such as Census Tract) however, is justifiable. Built environments in a small area are more homogeneous with central and outlying areas being more similar, thus better representing residents??? day-to-day activities (Ewing et al., 2014, 2003). Using a smaller area level could potentially lead to the increased explanatory and predictive power of urban sprawl on health outcomes, especially when individual-level rather than ecological analysis is conducted. Developing urban sprawl indices at small-area levels poses challenges for statistical modelling. A majority of past research applies non-spatial modelling. While this might not be an issue for analyses at large-area levels, it is potentially problematic for small-area analyses, given that small-area sprawl indicators (e.g., population density) tend to be similar in adjacent areas (a.k.a. the spatial autocorrelation issue). To address this issue, a spatial version of dimension-reduction statistical approaches such as spatial factor analysis is needed. Otherwise, biased and imprecise inferences could be obtained for urban sprawl estimations.
Although urban sprawl is a global issue, previous studies have been primarily conducted in the United States. The website of National Cancer Institute (https://gis.cancer.gov/tools/urban-sprawl/) provides nationwide urban sprawl indices at multiple geographical levels (i.e., metropolitan, county, and census tract) in the United States. In contrast, there have been fewer studies that explore urban sprawl in the Canadian context, usually at large-area levels. For example, Ross et al. (2007) created a urban sprawl index at the Canadian Metropolitan Area (CMA) level, which is an unweighted sum of three indicators, namely the proportion of single or detached dwellings in a CMA, dwelling density, and the percentage of CMA population living in an urban core. 
The objective this research is to develop a multi-dimensional, nationwide urban sprawl index for Canada at a small-area level (i.e., Census Tract, CT) using spatial statistical modelling, filling the gap that a comprehensive urban sprawl index at a fine spatial scale is missing in Canada.

## Chapter 2: Sprawl score indicators
This study included urban sprawl indicators along four dimensions, density, mix use, street connectivity, and centering. These dimensions have been widely used in the urban sprawl/compactness studies in North America (Ewing et al., 2014, 2003). Descriptions of these indicators are provided in Table 1.
